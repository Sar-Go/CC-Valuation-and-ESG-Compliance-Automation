# CC-Valuation-and-ESG-Compliance-Automation
## AI-Driven Carbon Credit Valuation and ESG Compliance Automation for Indian Energy Sector

### Problem Statement
India’s carbon credit markets are growing rapidly post-2023 CCTS (Carbon Credit Trading Scheme) implementation, but valuation, risk assessment, and compliance are plagued by:
- Non-standardized datasets
- Manual reporting and verification
- Complex multi-sector indicators (energy, agriculture, manufacturing)

*Need of the hour is real-time, predictive, and auditable AI frameworks to automate and optimize carbon credit trading, valuation, and regulatory compliance.*

### Data Sources
1. Indian Government & Regulatory:
   - Bharat Carbon Exchange/Ministry of Power emission targets (GHG, Scope 1–3 by sector)
   - Central Electricity Authority Baseline Carbon Dioxide Emission Database (Climatiq API, CO₂ factors)​
   - Data.gov.in CO₂ emissions datasets
   - CDP India/Global Greenhouse Gas datasets for cities ()​
2. Open Datasets:
   - Climatiq API for Carbon Footprint Calculations
   - Kaggle: India Renewable Energy, Power Generation, and GHG datasets​
   - ESG disclosure databases (from SEBI/BRSR filings, annual reports)
3. Corporate/Supply Chain:
   - Company-level energy, emissions, and ESG reports (text data)
   - Supply chain audits, IoT sensor/GIS emissions data (where available)

### Relevancy to Context
- Strategic Fit: Shell’s net-zero ambitions + India’s fast-evolving regulatory (CCTS/BRSR) landscape mean scoring, forecasting, and reporting accuracy is mission-critical.
- Production-Ready: Uses only open data + scalable ML; immediate business use in portfolio dashboards, sustainability-linked finance, ESG reporting.
- Global Leadership: Builds Shell's reputation in India as a pioneer in AI-driven carbon/ESG solutions—directly helps Shell optimize operations, meet investor expectations, and comply with regulatory mandates.
- FinTech Synergy: Seamlessly bridges energy data and sustainable finance, matching your background as a technologist and product builder.

### Deployment Flow:
- Ingest emission, usage, and ESG data from open APIs and company sources
- Preprocess and standardize (ETL pipelines) -> train regression, classification, and NLP models
- Deploy API endpoints/dashboard for real-time carbon credit scoring, ESG reporting, and risk flagging
- Integrate homegrown models into Shell's India ESG/operations/banking workflows (for demonstration & scaling)

### Potential Business Impact / Innovation Angle
- Price Discovery & Risk Management: 80% reduction in manual reporting effort, 60% faster risk flagging, and up to 70% reduction in regulatory risks for energy companies.​
- Market Transparency: Standardizes ESG and carbon valuation in line with CCTS/SEBI, boosting investor confidence.
- Real-Time Monitoring: Empowers companies (power, renewable, manufacturing) to instantly check compliance, simulate future carbon/ESG positions.
- Sustainable Finance: Streamlines transactions for sustainability-linked loans and green bonds via reliable AI-backed scoring.
